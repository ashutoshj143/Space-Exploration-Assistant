1. Introduction
Solar Sage is a chatbot designed to provide information and answer questions about space and the solar system. Utilizing state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology and NASA's API, Solar Sage aims to enhance user engagement and learning in the field of space exploration. Solar Sage is an AI chatbot crafted to be your space exploration companion. Its purpose is to help users delve into various space-related topics, offering easy insights and information. Whether you're a seasoned astronomer, student or a curious enthusiast, Solar Sage is here to make navigating the cosmos an enriching experience.
 
 2. Project Overview
The project integrates Streamlit for the user interface, Langchain for language model capabilities, and the NASA API for fetching space-related images and information. It provides an interactive platform where users can ask questions about space, and Solar Sage responds with accurate and informative answers. Solar Sage offers a range of features tailored to enhance your space exploration experience.
●	With its natural language understanding, it effortlessly comprehends your queries, making interaction intuitive and effortless.
●	Solar Sage is seamlessly integrated with the NASA API and provides up-to-date and accurate information on space phenomena and missions.
●	Its real-time responses ensure prompt and informative engagement, empowering users to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.

3. Methodology
 Data Collection
Solar Sage leverages NASA's API to fetch space-related images and information. This data serves as the primary source for answering user queries.
 
 Model Training
The language model used in Solar Sage is Ollama, trained on the Llama2 dataset. This model has been finetuned to understand and respond to questions about space and the solar system.
 

4. System Architecture
Solar Sage follows a client-server architecture, where the client interacts with the chatbot through a Streamlit-based user interface. The serverside logic handles user queries, fetches data from the NASA API, and utilizes the language model to generate responses.
  
•	The user asks the LLM a question about a product, such as “What are some options for a men’s large blue button-down shirt?”
•	The LLM reformulates the user’s question into a query 
•	The LLM sends the query to the shopping API and receives a response. The LLM then translates the API’s response into a human-readable format for the user.







5. Implementation

Code Overview
The code integrates various components, including Streamlit for the UI, Langchain for language model capabilities, and requests for interacting with the NASA API. It follows a modular structure to ensure maintainability and scalability.
 
 Interaction Flow
The user inputs questions through the Streamlit interface. The input is processed by the language model, which generates a response based on the provided prompt template. The response and any fetched images from the NASA API are displayed back to the user.
 

 


6. Results
 

●	Solar Sage accurately answers user queries, providing informative responses backed by data from NASA's API.
●	 Solar Sage encapsulates a wealth of features and capabilities to enhance the user's exploration of space-related topics.
●	 From its natural language understanding to its integration with the NASA API, Solar Sage offers a seamless and informative experience.
●	 Users can rely on Solar Sage to provide real-time responses, fostering curiosity and understanding of the cosmos.
●	 As a companion in space exploration, Solar Sage encourages users to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe with confidence and ease.
●	Solar Sage makes the cosmos more accessible and engaging, inviting users to embark on a journey of discovery and wonder.




 
7. Discussion
 Strengths and Weaknesses
Solar Sage's strengths lie in its ability to provide accurate information, its userfriendly interface, and its integration of multimedia elements. However, limitations may include occasional delays in fetching data from the NASA API and potential improvements in the language model's response quality.
 
 Future Improvements
Future enhancements for Solar Sage could involve optimizing API requests for faster response times, expanding the question database, and finetuning the language model for improved conversational capabilities.
 
8. Monetization Strategies
Solar Sage has the potential to generate revenue through various monetization strategies:
•	Subscription Model: Offer premium features or access to exclusive content for a subscription fee.
•	InApp Purchases: Users can purchase additional content, such as indepth space exploration guides or personalized consultations with experts.
•	Advertisement: Integrate targeted advertisements within the chat interface, leveraging the user engagement to attract advertisers.
•	Affiliate Marketing: Partner with space-related businesses or educational platforms and earn commissions for referring users to their products or services.
 
9. Conclusion
Solar Sage represents an innovative approach to engaging users in space exploration through a conversational interface. By combining NLP technology with real-time data from NASA, Solar Sage provides an interactive and educational experience for users interested in learning about the universe's wonders.
 
 
 
10. Business Understanding
●	Schools/Univesity-  We can rent this space bot on a subscription basis to schools and universities as it is heavily used during more space and solar system-related projects, and the information required by the students as it is directly fetching the data from the website and not trained like chat-gpt. 
●	Research/Educators- Educators and researchers studying various aspects of space science, astronomy, astrophysics, and related fields can benefit from Solar Sage's quick access to information, data, and updates on space missions, celestial events, and scientific discoveries.
This business overview section outlines potential monetization strategies for Solar Sage, enhancing its sustainability and revenue generation capabilities. Adjustments can be made based on market analysis and user feedback to optimize revenue streams.
